# nexial-webeasy

aka Nexial WebEZ.

A chrome-extension to simplify the _work_ of web automation (including test automation). Designed with the intentions to
be both a selector/locator inspection tool and a "helper" tool to ease the
[Nexial](https://nexiality.github.io/documentation/) script development.

Current feature set includes:

1. Track user actions (mostly typing and clicking) on a web page and translate them to the appropriate
   [Nexial commands](https://nexiality.github.io/documentation/commands/web/).
2. Ability to track across multiple websites. Start and stop the tracking at any point.
3. Derive at a set of reasonably useful and maintainable locators for each of the referenced element (such as a button
   or a text box). You have the option to select the locator that best fits your ideals.
4. Ability to add element and text related assertions directly from the current web page.
5. Transform user actions and corresponding locators into an on-screen automation _draft_, which you can further refine.
6. One-click Copy to send your final draft to your Nexial script, and you are ready to run it!
7. On-demand locator inspector -- Useful even if you are not using Nexial!
8. Oh ya, did we mention it's _**FREE**_?!
